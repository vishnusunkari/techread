### How to integrate kubecost with your kubernetes cluster   

#### First install kubecost within a kubernetes cluster   

The following helm command will install kubecost in a namespace called kubecost   

```
helm upgrade --install kubecost \
  --repo https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/ cost-analyzer \
  --namespace kubecost --create-namespace
```

You should now be able to access kubecost dashboard by port-forwarding as follows:   

```
kubectl port-forward --namespace kubecost deployment/kubecost-cost-analyzer 9090
Access kubecost at http://127.0.0.1:9090
```
But now you might want to make this kubecost dashboard accessible by a url.
Inorder to have an end-point for kubecost first you need to create a DNS Record and point it as an alias to the Load balancer 
of the ingress-nginx-controller service in your kubernetes cluster.   

Get the load-balancer details by getting the ingress service, in this case we are using nginx ingress controller :   

```
kubectl get svc -n <ingress-namespace>
```

Create an AWS Route53 DNS record "kubecost.dev.company.com" for an existing hosted zone : dev.company.com
and during the creation make it an alias pointing to your load balancer that you got in the previous step.    

Now you should be able to access your kubecost dashboard using the url : http://kubecost.dev.company.com
